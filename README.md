## Overview

This repository serves as a resource for understanding and implementing fundamental data structures. Whether you are new to programming or looking to refresh your knowledge, you'll find structured explanations and examples here.

## Data Structures

The repository covers the following data structures:

1. **Arrays**: Basic arrays and dynamic arrays.
2. **Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
3. **Stacks**: Implementation of stacks using arrays and linked lists.
4. **Queues**: Implementation of queues using arrays and linked lists.
5. **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and B-trees.
6. **Graphs**: Representation of graphs and common algorithms (DFS, BFS).
7. **Hash Tables**: Hash functions, collision handling (chaining, open addressing), and hash table implementations.
8. **Heaps**: Min heaps and max heaps.

Each data structure folder contains:
- Explanation of the data structure.
- Implementation examples in different programming languages (e.g., Python, Java).
- Code examples for common operations (insertion, deletion, traversal).
- Notes on time and space complexity considerations.
