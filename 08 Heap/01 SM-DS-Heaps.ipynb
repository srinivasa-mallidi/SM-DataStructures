    "#### **Introduction to Heaps**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Definition**: A heap is a complete binary tree where every parent node has a value less than or equal to (for a max heap) or greater than or equal to (for a min heap) the values of its children nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Max Heap**: Parent nodes are greater than or equal to their child nodes.\n",
    "    -   **Min Heap**: Parent nodes are less than or equal to their child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2\\. **Properties of Heaps**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Complete Binary Tree**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   All levels are fully filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n",
    "-   **Heap Order Property**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For a max heap, the key at each parent node is greater than or equal to the keys at its children nodes.\n",
    "    -   For a min heap, the key at each parent node is less than or equal to the keys at its children nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3\\. **Operations on Heaps**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Insertion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Add the new element at the next available position in the heap (last level, far-left).\n",
    "    -   Maintain the heap property by comparing the new element with its parent and swapping if necessary.\n",
    "-   **Deletion (Extract)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Remove the root element (either the maximum or minimum depending on the heap type).\n",
    "    -   Replace the root with the last element in the heap.\n",
    "    -   Restore the heap property by \"heapifying\" (moving down the tree and swapping with the largest or smallest child until the heap property is restored).\n",
    "-   **Peek (Get Maximum or Minimum)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Return the root element without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4\\. **Heapify Operation**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Heapify Up (Heapify Insert)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Used after insertion to maintain the heap property by moving the newly inserted element up the tree.\n",
    "-   **Heapify Down (Heapify Extract)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Used after deletion to maintain the heap property by moving the root element down the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5\\. **Applications of Heaps**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Priority Queues**: Efficiently retrieve the maximum or minimum element.\n",
    "-   **Heap Sort**: Sorting algorithm that uses a heap to sort elements in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "-   **Graph Algorithms**: Used in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6\\. **Advantages and Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Efficient for operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the maximum or minimum element (O(log n) time complexity).\n",
    "    -   Useful for scenarios requiring priority-based processing.\n",
    "-   **Considerations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Not suitable for operations that require access to arbitrary elements (like binary search trees).\n",
    "    -   Additional overhead in maintaining heap property during insertions and deletions.\n",
